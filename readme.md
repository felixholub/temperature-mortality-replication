# Replication Exercise: "Adapting to Climate Change: The Remarkable Decline in the U.S. Temperature-Mortality Relationship over the 20th Century"

## Description

This repository contains the code and data for Problem Set 7 of the ENEC course at Goethe University Frankfurt.
The data is taken from the paper:

> Barreca, A., Clay, K., Deschenes, O., Greenstone, M., & Shapiro, J. S. (2016). Adapting to Climate Change: The Remarkable Decline in the US Temperature-Mortality Relationship over the Twentieth Century. Journal of Political Economy, 124(1), 105â€“159. [https://doi.org/10.1086/684582](https://doi.org/10.1086/684582)

The code replicates Figures 2 of the Paper.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download and extract the ZIP-file under the green "Code" button.
2. Keep the code (`*.do`) and data (`*.dta`) in the same folder.
3. In Stata, execute `prepare.do` OR manually install from SSC: `ssc install reghdfe` and `ssc install coefplot`.
